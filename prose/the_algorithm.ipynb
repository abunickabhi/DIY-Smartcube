    "### The Algorithm\r\n",
    "We decided to approach the problem by designing a sound-based protocol for the supercube. We mapped each possible face turn to a specific tone. We then designed a sound analysis algorithm to decode a sequence of tones into a sequence of face turns.\r\n",

    "#### Protocol Requirements\r\n",
    "Sound is an easily accessible, and therefore noisy medium of communication. As a result, any data transmission protocol must \r\n",

    "IDEA: Discuss the use cases for each criteria, and conclude with a statement of it in a large, centered \"quote block\". Format similar to the 47 Principles of Financial Fitness.\r\n",

    "Each of the Rubik's Cube's six faces has four possible positions, for a total of 24 unique tones required for our protocol.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The following criteria guided the tone selection process:\r\n",
    " - *Signal-to-Noise Ratio*: Each selected tone must be easily distinguished from background noise in a quiet room.\r\n",
    "   * Lower frequency tones (e.g. < 100Hz) are more prominent in background noise.\r\n",
    "   * Analysis based on this criterion should also consider the background noise generated by the rotation of the Rubik's Cube itself.\r\n",
    "   * Most of the concerns involved in this criteria are solved by increasing the volume of the generated tone.\r\n",
    " - *Separation from other Tones*: Each selected tone must be easily distinguished from each other tone. \r\n",
    "   * Our testing with smartphone microphones suggested that tones needed to be separated by at least 100Hz to be uniquely detected from each other.\r\n",
    "   * We can also exploit the fact that only one of each faces four positions will be active at a time.\r\n",
    " - *Ease of Production/Consumption on Consumer Hardware*: Each selected tone must be easily produced by a consumer grade speaker and consumed by a consumer grade microphone.\r\n",
    "    * A typical smartphone can produce and consume tones in the human auditory range of 10Hz - 20kHz (TODO source).\r\n",
    " - *Human Auditory Range*: Tone selection shall be biased in favor of tones beyond the typical human auditory range; however, in intial prototypes, this criterion is subordinate to all other criteria.\r\n",
    "   * Many humans are unable to hear tones above 17kHz (TODO how many? source?)\r\n",
