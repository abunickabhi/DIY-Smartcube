    "At the time of writing, there are three commercial smart cubes: the Gans 356i, the Giiker Cube, and the Go Cube. All three use an array of 6 rotary encoders (one for each face) connected to a microcontroller that converts the analog rotary readings to digital signals transmitted to a smartphone/computer via a small bluetooth radio also embedded into the cube.\r\n",
