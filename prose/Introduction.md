## Introduction
In 1974, Erno Rubik, a Hungarian professor of architecture, sought to help his students visualize space in three dimensions. To that end, he created a special cube whose faces could independently rotate around all three physical axes [^ernorubik-motivation]. When he added colored stickers to further aid in visualizing the movements, Mr. Rubik realized he had created a new puzzle. He patented his cube in 1975, [^ernorubik-patent] and since then over 450 million units have been sold [^sold-count], allowing an estimated 1 in 7 humans on earth to try their hand at solving it [^used-count].

Since then, the cube has been the subject of academic research, competition, leisure, and cultural iconography.
