\section{Introduction}

TODO, be a *neutral* presentation of the current state of this technology. Give a big information dump to the reader.


\section{Commercial Smartcubes}

TODO, name the major smartcubes on the market and give a high-level overview of their features.

\subsection{Giiker Cube}
TODO Describe the Giiker Cube and its features. Explain the inner workings using the FCC pictures.

\subsection{Go Cube}
TODO Describe the Go Cube and its features. Explain the inner workings using the FCC pictures.

\subsection{Gans 356i}
TODO Describe the Gans 356i Cube and its features. Explain the inner workings using the FCC pictures.


\section{Academia}

\subsection{Rotary Encoders + Bluetooth}
TODO Discuss the viability of using rotary encoders + bluetooth for making a smart cube. Make sure to discuss the difference between absolute/relative rotary encoders.


\subsection{Sound}
TODO discuss the viability of using sound for making a smart cube.

\subsubsection{Google's "Data Over Sound" Project}
TODO discuss the Google's "data over sound" project and its applicability to this problem space.


\subsection{Computer Vision}
TODO discuss the viability of using sound for making a smart cube.

\subsubsection{OpenAI}
TODO discuss OpenAI's rubik's cube hand robot.
\subsubsection{Various GitHub Projects}
TODO discuss the various other GitHub projects relates to Rubik's Cube computing.


\subsection{Other Approaches}

TODO In this section I'm laying out a structure for discussing several of the options I looked into but ultimately disregarded. Should that go in the State of the Art chapter? or would it fit better in the Evaluation chapter to contrast against the potential of the sound-based implementation?

\subsubsection{RFID}
TODO discuss the viability of using RFID for making a smart cube.
\subsubsection{Magnetic Resonance}
TODO discuss the viability of using magnetic resonance for making a smart cube.
\subsubsection{Muscle-Tracking Armband}
TODO discuss the viability of using a muscle tracking armband for making a smart cube.


\section{Choice of Sound for My Thesis}

TODO This section might be large enough to merit its own chapter...
TODO Briefly detail the rationale for chosing to pursue a sound-based approach.
