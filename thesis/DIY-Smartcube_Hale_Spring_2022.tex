\begin{abstract}
\addchaptertocentry{\abstractname} % Add the abstract to the table of contents

Speedsolving, the art of solving twisty puzzles like the Rubik's Cube
as fast as possible, has recently benefitted from the arrival of
smartcubes which have special hardware for tracking the cube's face
turns and transmitting them via Bluetooth. However, due to their
embedded electronics, existing smartcubes cannot be used in
competition, reducing their utility in personal speedcubing practice.

This thesis proposes a sound-based design for tracking the face turns
of a standard, non-smart speedcube consisting of an audio processing
receiver in software and a small physical speaker configured as a
transmitter. Special attention has been given to ensuring that
installing the transmitter requires only a reversible centercap
replacement on the original cube. This allows the cube to benefit from
smartcube features during practice, while still maintaining compliance
with competition regulations.

Within a controlled test environment, the software receiver perfectly
detected a variety of transmitted move sequences. Furthermore, all
components required for the physical transmitter were demonstrated to
fit within the centercap of a Gans 356 speedcube.

\addchaptertocentry{\acknowledgementname} % Add the acknowledgements to the table of contents

The first order of gratitude goes to my wonderful wife. Though this
project has consumed much of my attention throughout our entire
friendship, courtship, and marriage, she has been my greatest source of
encouragement and support.

Additional gratitude goes to my parents, particularly my father-in-law
who spent hours with me at the workbench guiding me as I pieced
together transmitter prototypes.

Finally, gratitude goes to Dr. Heinrichs for his patience through
weekly meetings for a two-year project originally scheduled for only
one year. His guidance has been instrumental throughout the entire
project. Dr. Li's infusion of confidence from the start of the project
was also inspiring.
